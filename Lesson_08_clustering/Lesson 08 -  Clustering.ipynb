These are both types of [supervised machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning). In supervised learning, you train an algorithm to predict an unknown variable from known variables.\n","\n","Another major type of machine learning is called [unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning). In unsupervised learning, we aren't trying to predict anything. Instead, we're finding patterns in data.\n","\n","One of the main unsupervised learning techniques is called **clustering**. We use clustering when we're trying to explore a dataset, and understand the connections between the various rows and columns. For example, we can cluster NBA players based on their statistics. Here's how such a clustering might look:\n","\n","<center><img width=\"600\" alt=\"creating a repo\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1NUuctg1HZwvCQlFJTAYzsqgrhlDpi5VB\"></center>\n","\n","\n","**The clusters made it possible to discover player roles that might not have been noticed otherwise**.

There can be one or more groups in the data, and these groups form the clusters. As we look at the clusters, we can start to better understand the structure of the data.\n","\n","Clustering is a key way to explore unknown data, and it's a very commonly used machine learning technique.

Getting a bill passed by the Senate is a key step towards getting its provisions enacted. A **majority vote is required** to get a bill passed.\n","\n","The results of these votes, known as roll call votes, are public, and available in a few places, including [here](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress). Read more about the US legislative system [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States#Legislative_branch).\n","\n","**Senators typically vote in accordance with how their political party votes**, known as voting along party lines. In the US, the 2 main political parties are the [Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party), who tend to be [liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism), and the [Republicans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party), who tend to be [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism). **Senators** can also choose to be unaffiliated with a party, and vote as **Independents**, although very few choose to do so.\n","\n","**114_congress.csv** contains all of the results of roll call votes from the **114th Senate**. Each row represents a single Senator, and each column represents a vote. A 0 in a cell means the Senator voted No on the bill, 1 means the Senator voted Yes, and 0.5 means the Senator abstained.\n","\n","Here are the relevant columns:\n","\n","- **name** -- The last name of the Senator.\n","- **party** -- the party of the Senator. The valid values are __D__ for Democrat, __R__ for Republican, and __I__ for Independent.\n","- Several columns numbered like **00001**, **00004**, etc. Each of these columns represents the results of a single roll call vote.\n","\n","Below are the first three rows of the data.

For instance, squaring [1,2,3] results in [1,4,9], and cubing it results in [1,8,27].\n","\n","We cube the distances so that we can get a good amount of separation between the extremists who are farther away from a party, who have distances that look like extremist = [3.4, .24], and moderates, whose distances look like moderate = [2.6, 2]. If we left the distances as is, we'd end up with 3.4 + .24 = 3.64, and 2.6 + 2 = 4.6, which would make the moderate, who is between both parties, seem extreme.
