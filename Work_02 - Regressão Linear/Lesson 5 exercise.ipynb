Each row in the dataset describes the properties of a single house as well as the amount it was sold for. In this course, we'll build models that predict the final sale price from its other attributes. Specifically, we'll explore the following questions:\n","\n","- Which properties of a house most affect the final sale price?\n","- How effectively can we predict the sale price from just its properties?\n","\n","This dataset was originally compiled by [Dean De Cock](http://www.truman.edu/faculty-staff/decock/) for the primary purpose of having a high quality dataset for regression.

Regression\n","\n","\n","We'll start by understanding the univariate case of linear regression, also known as **simple linear regression**. The following equation is the general form of the simple linear regression model.\n","\n","$$\\hat{y}=a_1x_1+a_0$$\n","\n","$\\hat{y}$ represents the target column while $x_1$ represents the feature column we choose to use in our model. These values are independent of the dataset. On the other hand, $a_0$ and $a_1$ represent the **parameter** values that are specific to the dataset. The goal of simple linear regression is to find the optimal parameter values that best describe the relationship between the feature column and the target column. The following diagram shows different simple linear regression models depending on the data:\n","\n","<img width=\"500\" alt=\"creating a repo\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1aYSv01fP3tEoEukxRmMZFcfJwZfzS-UV\">\n","\n","\n","The first step is to select the feature, $x_1$, we want to use in our model. Once we select this feature, we can use scikit-learn to determine the optimal parameter values $a_1$ and $a_0$ based on the training data. Because one of the assumptions of linear regression is that the relationship between the feature(s) and the target column is linear, we want to pick a feature that seems like it has the strongest correlation with the final sale price.\n","\n","**Exercise Start**\n","\n","<img width=\"100\" alt=\"creating a repo\"

If you recall, we computed the critical points by calculating the curve's derivative, setting it equal to 0, and finding the x value at this point. Unfortunately, this approach won't work when we have multiple parameter values because minimizing one parameter value may increase another parameter's value. In addition, while we can plot the MSE curve when we only have a single parameter we're trying to find and visually select the value that minimizes the MSE, this approach won't work when we have multiple parameter value because we can't visualize past 3 dimensions.\n","\n","In this mission, we'll explore an iterative technique for solving this problem, known as **gradient descent**. The [gradient descent algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) works by iteratively trying different parameter values until the model with the lowest mean squared error is found. Gradient descent is a commonly used optimization technique for other models as well, like neural networks, which we'll explore later in this track.\n","\n","Here's an overview of the gradient descent algorithm for a single parameter linear regression model:\n","\n","- select initial values for the parameter: $a_1$\n","- repeat until convergence (usually implemented with a max number of iterations):\n","    - calculate the error (MSE) of model that uses current parameter value: $MSE(a_1)=\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\\hat{y}^{(i)}−y^{(i)})^2$\n","    - calculate the derivative of the error (MSE) at the current parameter value: $\\frac{d}{da_1}MSE(a_1)$\n","    - update the parameter value by subtracting the derivative times a constant ($\\alpha$, called the learning rate): $a_1:=a_1−\\alpha \\frac{d}{da_1}MSE(a_1)$\n","    \n","    \n","In the last step of the algorithm, you'll notice we used we used := to indicate that the value on the right is assigned to the variable on the left. While in Python, we've used to the equals operator (=) for assignment, we've used it in math (=) to signify equality. For example, a = 1 in Python assigns the value 1 to the variable a. In math, a=1 asserts that a is equal to 1. In mathematical papers, sometimes $\\leftarrow$ is also used to signify assignment:\n","\n","$a_1\\leftarrow a_1 − \\alpha \\frac{d}{da_1}MSE(a_1)$\n","\n","Selecting an appropriate initial parameter and learning rate will reduce the number of iterations required to converge, and is part of hyperparameter optimization.

Linear regression operates under the assumption that the features are linearly correlated with the target column. For a categorical feature, however, there's no actual numerical meaning to the categorical codes that pandas assigned for that colum.

For example, a house that was built in **1960** but sold in **1980** was sold in half the time one built in **1960** and sold in **2000**. Instead of the years certain events happened, we want the difference between those years. We should create a new column that's the difference between both of these columns.\n","\n","For this particular piece of information (years until remodeled), this is a sensible approach. Domain knowledge can help you understand how to best transform features to represent information well for a linear model.

You can also read about the different columns in the data [here](https://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt).\n","\n","Let's start by setting up a pipeline of functions that will let us quickly iterate on different models.\n","\n","\n","<img width=\"200\" alt=\"creating a repo\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ZEtgNq4ig4GfQWZQlOulAHLRu1JKfiKh\">\n","\n"]},{"metadata":{"id":"gqoQ8N2R3nmp","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","pd.options.display.max_columns = 999\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from sklearn.model_selection import KFold\n","\n","from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\n","from sklearn import linear_model\n","from sklearn.model_selection import KFold"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"vSemPcqX363u","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["df = pd.read_csv(\"AmesHousing.txt\", delimiter=\"\\t\")"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"1HOi5e_e4BNH","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"outputId":"5bba5a1b-ebb9-4927-ae5a-2510383ae384","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1538353077160,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":1533,"user":{"displayName":"Lucileide Medeiros Dantas da Silva","photoUrl":"","userId":"04566619547103276114"}}},"cell_type":"code","source":["def transform_features(df):\n","    return df\n","\n","def select_features(df):\n","    return df[[\"Gr Liv Area\", \"SalePrice\"]]\n","\n","def train_and_test(df):  \n","    train = df[:1460]\n","    test = df[1460:]\n","    \n","    ## You can use `pd.DataFrame.select_dtypes()` to specify column types\n","    ## and return only those columns as a data frame.\n","    numeric_train = train.select_dtypes(include=['integer', 'float'])\n","    numeric_test = test.select_dtypes(include=['integer', 'float'])\n","    \n","    ## You can use `pd.Series.drop()` to drop a value.\n","    features = numeric_train.columns.drop(\"SalePrice\")\n","    lr = linear_model.LinearRegression()\n","    lr.fit(train[features], train[\"SalePrice\"])\n","    predictions = lr.predict(test[features])\n","    mse = mean_squared_error(test[\"SalePrice\"], predictions)\n","    rmse = np.sqrt(mse)\n","    \n","    return rmse\n","\n","transform_df = transform_features(df)\n","filtered_df = select_features(transform_df)\n","rmse = train_and_test(filtered_df)\n","\n","rmse"],"execution_count":195,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["57088.25161263909"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":195}]},{"metadata":{"id":"OHOQs2rV4HXi","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 7.2 Feature Engineering\n","\n","Handle missing values:\n","  - All columns:\n","    - Drop any with 5% or more missing values for now.\n","  - Text columns:\n","    - Drop any with 1 or more missing values for now.\n","  - Numerical columns:\n","     - For columns with missing values, fill in with the most common value in that column\n","     \n","1: All columns: Drop any with 5% or more missing values **for now**.\n","\n"]},{"metadata":{"id":"jnicBXgu4whY","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["## Series object: column name -> number of missing values\n","num_missing = df.isnull().sum()"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"ZPbzdOUp40Ju","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["# Filter Series to columns containing >5% missing values\n","drop_missing_cols = num_missing[(num_missing > len(df)/20)].sort_values()\n","\n","# Drop those columns from the data frame.
